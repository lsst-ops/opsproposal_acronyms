cloud	A visible mass of condensed water vapor floating in the atmosphere, typically high above the ground or in interstellar space acting as the birthplace for stars.  Also a way of computing (on other peoples computers leveraging their services and availability).
cold storage	Data moved to cold storage means data moved to cheaper slower storage such as tape. The assumption is this is no longer accessed frequently.
community software	Software developed for and shared among a large group of relatively like-minded users (e.g. astronomers). Typically, but not necessarily, open source software and open development-based.
container	A container is a software package that contains everything the software needs to run. This includes the executable program as well as system tools, libraries, and settings. ... For example, a container that includes PHP and MySQL can run identically on both a Linux computer and a Windows machine.
cyberinfrastructure	Sometimes denoted CI, A term first used by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), and it typically is used to refer to information technology systems that provide particularly powerful and advanced capabilities.
git	The most widely used DVCS software
interoperability	the ability of systems or software to exchange and make use of information between them.
open development	A process for developing software that emphasizes all code contribution and decision-making be done in the open, available to as wide a group as possible (This usually means anyone with internet access).
open source software	Open source software is a type of software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Note that this is \emph{not} necessarily the same as open to contribution (see open development).
parquet	Parquet File Format Hadoop. Parquet, an open source file format for Hadoop. Parquet stores nested data structures in a flat columnar format. Compared to a traditional approach where data is stored in row-oriented approach, parquet is more efficient in terms of storage and performance.
reproducibility	(this one should have many definitions and we have to say WHICH version we are talking about) The ability to combine the same code and data and get the same result, or the ability to use the same code with different data to enforce a result, or there may be others
software	The programs and other operating information used by a computer.
valley of death	Most startups fail within three years. Funding is easier in year one and profitability often takes four years, if they get past that they are out of the valley of death. Many technology problems face a similar adoption problem
version control	The management of changes to documents, computer programs, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and merged
