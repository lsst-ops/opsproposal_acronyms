configuration	A task-specific set of configuration parameters, also called a 'config'. The config is read-only; once a task is constructed, the same configuration will be used to process all data. This makes the data processing more predictable: it does not depend on the order in which items of data are processed. This is distinct from arguments or options, which are allowed to vary from one task invocation to the next
data collection	A data collection in the second-generation (Gen2) Butler (referred to as a data repository in earlier generations) consists of hierarchically organized data files, an inventory or registry of the contents (i.e., metadata from the data files) stored in an sqlite3 file, and a Mapper file that specifies to the LSST Stack software the camera model to apply when accessing the data in the data repository
declination	Often abbreviated Dec, it is a part of an equatorial coordinate pair that expresses the angular distance (usually expressed in degrees) from the Celestial Equator, measured along great circles that intersect the Equatorial poles. Positions south of the equator are given negative sign
flux	Shorthand for radiative flux, it is a measure of the transport of radiant energy per unit area per unit time. In astronomy this is usually expressed in cgs units: erg/cm2/s
footprint	See 'source footprint', 'instrumental footprint', or 'survey footprint', `Footprint` is a Python class representing a source footprint
forced photometry	A measurement of the photometric properties of a source, or expected source, with one or more parameters held fixed. Most often this means fixing the location of the center of the brightness profile (which may be known or predicted in advance), and measuring other properties such as total brightness, shape, and orientation. Forced photometry will be done for all Objects in the Data Release Production
middleware	Software that acts as a bridge between other systems or software usually a database or network. Specifically in the Data Management System this refers to Butler for data access and Workflow management for distributed processing.
monitoring	In DM QA, this refers to the process of collecting, storing, aggregating and visualizing metrics
passband	The window of wavelength or the energy range admitted by an optical system; specifically the transmission as a function of wavelength or energy. Typically the passband is limited by a filter. The width of the passband may be characterized in a variety of ways, including the width of the half-power points of the transmission curve, or by the equivalent width of a filter with 100% transmission within the passband, and zero elsewhere
patch	An quadrilateral sub-region of a sky tract, with a size in pixels chosen to fit easily into memory on desktop computers
photometric redshift	Often abbreviated to photo-z, this is an estimate of the true redshift (of a galaxy) determined from multi-band photometry. Generally determined from a fit of source colors to grid of model SEDs with redshift
pipeline	A configured sequence of software tasks (Stages) to process data and generate data products. Example: Association Pipeline
point spread function	The point-spread function (PSF) is the distribution of intensity on a sensor (or image) originating from an unresolved point-source (i.e., a star). Often the PSF is not the same Airy shape as would be expected from a finite-aperture optical system, owing primarily to atmospheric effects and imperfections in the optical system and the detector
precovery	The process of finding, or putting upper limits on, detections of a newly discovered DIAObject in previously obtained images, typically using forced photometry. Alert Packets will contain precovery data derived from the past 30 days of images that include the location of a new DIAObject
seeing	An astronomical term for characterizing the stability of the atmosphere, as measured by the width of the point-spread function on images. The PSF width is also affected by a number of other factors, including the airmass, passband, and the telescope and camera optics
shape	In reference to a Source or Object, the shape is a functional characterization of its spatial intensity distribution, and the integral of the shape is the flux. Shape characterizations are a data product in the DIASource, DIAObject, Source, and Object catalogs
stack	a grouping, usually in layers (hence stack), of software packages and services to achieve a common goal. Often providing a higher level set of end user oriented services and tools
survey footprint	The portion of the sky covered by data from an astronomical survey, e.g., the main wide-fast-deep LSST 10-year survey, the LSST deep drilling fields, or the Science Validation data taken during commissioning.  Sometimes represented by Boolean maps or other summary statistics in an all-sky representation, e.g., the IVOA MOC standard
tracklet	Links between unassociated DIASources within one night to identify moving objects
tract	A portion of sky, a spherical convex polygon, within the LSST all-sky tessellation (sky map). Each tract is subdivided into sky patches
transient	A transient source is one that has been detected on a difference image, but has not been associated with either an astronomical object or a solar system body
