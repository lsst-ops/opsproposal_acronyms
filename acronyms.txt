open source software	Open source software is a type of software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Note that this is \emph{not} necessarily the same as open to contribution (see open development).
reproducibility	(this one should have many definitions and we have to say WHICH version we are talking about) The ability to combine the same code and data and get the same result, or the ability to use the same code with different data to enforce a result, or there may be others
software	The programs and other operating information used by a computer.
