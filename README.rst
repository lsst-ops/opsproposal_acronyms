Acronyms for ops proposal
##################################

Dump the proposal as text  like Draf.txt and put it in this directory.

If you want to play with google you can  use the grabDoc.py script to get the text form of the google doc. 
It will require you to click on some " are you sure you want to do this" things. 

The makefile should then work - type 'make'.

You need generateAcronyms.py in your path - this is part of lsst-texmf see: https://lsst-texmf.lsst.io/lsstdoc.html#acronyms-or-glossaries


put the contents of acronyms.txt in the document.
